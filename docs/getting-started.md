Welcome to Growing Cold Climate Grapes! We are excited that you've decided to come on this journey with us.

Before you start the modules, please take the pre-course survey on the next page.

After the survey, dive right into the heart of the course, starting with Module 1: [The Life of a Grapevine](life-of-grapevine "The Life of a Grapevine") Use the left and right arrows in the module to navigate from page to page. Once you finish Module 1, continue on to Module 2. If you get lost, simply click either Syllabus or Modules on the lefthand column in order to see a full list of the modules. These modules build upon each other, so it is best to complete them in order.

After you complete the modules, take the "Post-Course Survey,"  and then you are finished! 

You can find the complete Growing Grapes in Minnesota, Midwest Grape Production Guide, and Midwest Fruit Pest Management in [Resources](https://canvas.umn.edu/courses/142768/modules/372065 "Resources")

This course is funded thanks in large part to the Sustainable Agricultural Research and Education ([SARE (Links to an external site)](https://www.sare.org/)) program.
