This is John Thull speaking with you.</p><p>Today we&#x27;re going to present this talk on the vine through the growing season.</p><p>It&#x27;s a talk that we originally given in February of this year at the cold climate conference. And unfortunately, Jenny will not be able to join us today with this one.</p><p>But let&#x27;s begin here and take a stroll through the vineyard through the season.</p><p>Spoiler alert, I guess upfront, you know, growing grapes is not exactly like they always portrayed in the movies, but I don&#x27;t, they still feel like there&#x27;s some room for that romance, right? I mean, growing vines is, is really a cool thing.</p><p>And I think it should be grown. You should be growing your vines passionately with both heart and knowledge, as you can see in this photo here.</p><p>This is a shot from the Mosul River where they grow vines in a very interesting way in Germany with that little Mosul, hard shape to the vines just goes to show there&#x27;s lots of different ways to do this in different scenarios.</p><p>So we&#x27;ll see what we&#x27;re doing here in Minnesota. Throughout this presentation, one of the first things that help you understand growing grapes through the season is understanding that there&#x27;s lots of different ways of describing the vine throughout the season. And you can see in this chart, this icon Lorenz growth stage, stages of grapevines. &gt;&gt; There&#x27;s many different terms that you should familiar, familiarize yourself with, especially, but the difference between buds swell and but burst and bloom. &gt;&gt; And when that flowering Athens as well as for reagan and so forth. &gt;&gt; So this chart is just a good starting point to get you acquainted with what is the, what is the vine doing at different parts of the season? And it&#x27;s something that you can reference online pretty easily. &gt;&gt; Along with that, I want you to be aware of that. &gt;&gt; There&#x27;s, there&#x27;s really two things going on in the, in the vine. &gt;&gt; In the vine is growing its vegetative shoot tips and leaves and so forth, but at the same time it&#x27;s developing its fruit. &gt;&gt; So there&#x27;s a growth cycle going on as well as an accompanying fruit cycle that&#x27;s happening. &gt;&gt; And as you can see in this shot, different, different parts of the season you have. &gt;&gt; Fruit is going from Bloom all the way to fully matured fruit in a matter of a few months. &gt;&gt; But there&#x27;s something else interesting going on that I think beginning growers don&#x27;t always realize is that the fruit for next season is also being initiated during the season, during the current season. &gt;&gt; So what does that mean? &gt;&gt; This, this on login initiation. &gt;&gt; What are these on login? &gt;&gt; It&#x27;s a term used to describe the fundamental and the rudimentary parts of the flowers that we&#x27;ll be making flowers and next season and making fruit for next season. &gt;&gt; So let&#x27;s clarify this a little further. &gt;&gt; If you look at that chart that we just looked at, the EL the icon Lorenz chart If you look at stage 15, that&#x27;s that&#x27;s roughly the time when these on login are beginning to initiate. And on login is basically the earliest signs of developing next year&#x27;s flower clusters. So if that&#x27;s happening around the EL 15 stage, where somewhere at about maybe like a foot long shoot, a foot and a half long length and shoots and, and slightly before the flowering or before the Bloom. And this. &gt;&gt; So even while you&#x27;re buying and has the flower for this season, just realize that your flowers for the next season are also initiating inside those buds that we&#x27;ll be developing throughout the summer for next year. And we&#x27;ll clarify this a little bit more yet just to drive it home. &gt;&gt; So this is kind of the box, the red box now, a sort of indicating where those on login are developing as the shoots are developing during that time a year, throat late May and into June. So let&#x27;s, let&#x27;s just take a little example. &gt;&gt; If you can realize now that it takes about 15 to 18 months to bring on login from that developing stage to complete fruition or fruiting to harvest time. &gt;&gt; It&#x27;s, it&#x27;s 15 to 18 months. So let&#x27;s just pretend we&#x27;re back in 2019 and where it late me, that&#x27;s when these on login would&#x27;ve been developing. &gt;&gt; And now you can see in that shot we also have the, the initials flowers for the flower cluster primordia or excuse me, the flower in flip inflorescences are there as well in late May of 2019. &gt;&gt; But now realized that down in the axles of the leaves that the bud is developing for next season as well. &gt;&gt; And those leaf primordia developing in there and the analog and begin to form after those, those leaves are starting to form down in that, in that, but that&#x27;s kinda tight down there in the it&#x27;s basically the summer, but that is supposed to stay sleeping until next year. &gt;&gt; And as you can see here, so that&#x27;s what that bud is looking like, an August, as we&#x27;re nearing harvest for the current season of 2019, we got fruit hanging on there. &gt;&gt; The, the flower primordia are getting pretty pronounced by August, but there&#x27;s still an encapsulated in those, but so let&#x27;s go a little further. &gt;&gt; Flower initiation is basically what that means is your fruit set for the next season is largely determined before the vines go dormant. &gt;&gt; So now we bring ourselves into the current season of 20-20. &gt;&gt; And those, those flowers have basically been under development for about eight months already. &gt;&gt; And here they look like, like kinda like a branching little bit of a broccoli almost. And as they come out and develop. &gt;&gt; So you go from April all the way to September. &gt;&gt; That&#x27;s when you see that. &gt;&gt; Fruit, of course. &gt;&gt; So if that&#x27;s not clear enough, let&#x27;s just take a look at this in real photos. &gt;&gt; So if we start at month 0, being May of 2019, this is what we&#x27;re looking at at the top right corner. &gt;&gt; Ok? &gt;&gt; Then you drop down, go through the season. &gt;&gt; You&#x27;ve got harvest coming up in September, that&#x27;s at 104. &gt;&gt; Then you go through the winter, you go to the bottom left corner and we&#x27;re back at May. So that&#x27;s month 12. So this is kind of where we&#x27;re almost approaching. &gt;&gt; We&#x27;re not quite at that stage today, but we&#x27;re getting close to that. &gt;&gt; So as you can see, the the flowers that were there and 10 of May last year became the fruit of that year, right? &gt;&gt; But all the while, the flowers for the next season we&#x27;re developing during that whole time as well. &gt;&gt; And so basically your, your fruit then took 15 to 18 ones basically to come into, come into play and harvest. &gt;&gt; So there you see in the top left corner there, that&#x27;s month 16 of September. &gt;&gt; So it&#x27;s kinda like There&#x27;s 22 things going on at once in these things. &gt;&gt; So anyway, it&#x27;s sort of fun to realize that I don&#x27;t wanna get too caught up on this, even though I spend a lot of time and but just realize that the buds for next year are found at those growing shoots, at the nodes there. &gt;&gt; Alright? And those, those, those in fluorescence without flour primordia are found inside those buttons, and the size and the degree of branching on those flowers are very much influenced by this, the current seasons conditions. &gt;&gt; Alright, so some years you get really, really nice branching fruit. On the years you&#x27;ve got really, really reduce tight clusters. And that basically depends on the weather and how much crop you are carrying cell as a couple effect and all that. So anyway, it&#x27;s just really good to become familiar with all those different stages of the vine. There&#x27;s everything from dormancy too early, but swell late, but swell, but burst, which we&#x27;re kind of at this moment to the one to three and shoot stage. &gt;&gt; We&#x27;re sort of looking at that right at the moment on May 11th, 2020, right now. &gt;&gt; And then you move in Beyond that, you know, fairly quickly. You go to four to eight inches and shoot length and then ten to 16 inches. &gt;&gt; And then pretty soon will be immediately pre blue, which will be in June. &gt;&gt; And then first Blum. Blum takes a little while to come into full bloom. &gt;&gt; Then you get the buckshot shot berry development soon after the bloom is finished. &gt;&gt; So we&#x27;re looking at late June, early July. &gt;&gt; And then by somewhere in July, you get a bunch closure. &gt;&gt; And usually late July, early August, we start to hit some vibration, some of our varieties. &gt;&gt; Then we know that harvest isn&#x27;t too far away and harvest is September, October. &gt;&gt; And then we enter into the senescence phase, where things start to dwindle and decline. &gt;&gt; Not exactly like that photo there, but and then we hit dormancy again. &gt;&gt; So what, uh, put together for you is just this vineyard schedule that shows all of these. &gt;&gt; The stages in jobs related to what&#x27;s going on according to the month. So along the top there, you can see the months on this chart, January through December. &gt;&gt; And then right below that in the colored boxes, we have some of the major phenological events in the vineyard or of the vine, such as bud swell, bud break, Blue Berets, vibration and harvest just as reference points. &gt;&gt; And that kind of roughly around those times that they equate with. &gt;&gt; So then below that, you can see there&#x27;s all those different vineyard viticultural tasks, such as pruning, tying, the sectoring, shoot thinning, positioning, leaf pulling, so forth. Fruit thinning, shoot trimming, protecting the fruit with nets, monitoring fruit ripeness, harvest on and on and on. &gt;&gt; And then also, like other jobs that are kind of outside of the realm of a mature, you&#x27;d be establishing new vines and training young vines in those. And you can just see how it drops down from the month to what, where we&#x27;re kind of doing though is those different jobs. &gt;&gt; There&#x27;s plenty of other activities going on in the vineyard. At the same time, we have herbicide applications that we&#x27;re doing this clearing, the pruning is out of the vineyard and bowings, all those boxes with the m running across there, those are times where you could be mowing. &gt;&gt; I&#x27;m not saying that you&#x27;re mowing all of these times. &gt;&gt; Maybe you are. &gt;&gt; If you&#x27;ve got a very showy showcase type of the vineyard that&#x27;s very open to the public. You want to keep it looking good if your country and you don&#x27;t need to keep it as, as photogenic for weddings or whatever. &gt;&gt; You don&#x27;t need to be mowing that often. &gt;&gt; But again, also with the fungicide insecticide applications. &gt;&gt; There you can see there&#x27;s a lot of timings listed. &gt;&gt; There&#x27;s a few key ones that we&#x27;ll get into and talk about it. &gt;&gt; But it&#x27;s not like you have to be doing every single one of these. &gt;&gt; It&#x27;s just this is just an example of showing where some of those timelines fall. &gt;&gt; Also, there&#x27;s fertilizing if needed somewhere there. And me, irrigation isn&#x27;t as another job that happened some years more than others. &gt;&gt; And I&#x27;ll fixing erosion spots, soil sampling, inventorying, ordering supplies, equipment, trainings, all that stuff and then are out there. &gt;&gt; And that is sort of in the middle of the chart. &gt;&gt; I just I put in where I could fit some pest control and netting, rolling the nets, sewing grass seed in a new vineyard trellis installation, poetry placement, labeling your rows with numbers and such. &gt;&gt; You can fit that in whenever you can during the season that doesn&#x27;t have to be happening right there in August, September, October, it&#x27;s listed, but, and then in December, usually people are thinking the vineyard is done and sleeping. &gt;&gt; But don&#x27;t forget about those voles and mice. &gt;&gt; It&#x27;s a thing that you might want to be thinking about is bathing those guys and keeping their numbers down for them. &gt;&gt; So let&#x27;s just take a little bit of a look at pruning verse. &gt;&gt; I don&#x27;t want to spend a lot of time because we&#x27;ll be talking more about the vine and how it&#x27;s growing during the season. &gt;&gt; But you gotta have a starting point, right? &gt;&gt; So this is pruning is something that usually can begin in January. &gt;&gt; But you gotta ask yourself. How many lines do you have and when do you expect that bud swelled to happen? &gt;&gt; So if you&#x27;ve got a small venue, you can start pruning later as long as you get it finished before the buds are swelling. &gt;&gt; And you just have to know how fast you are, right? &gt;&gt; So And But what if that bud swell happens early and you got a big vineyard solely here, if it&#x27;s indicating that we&#x27;re gonna get bots well, late March, early April, and you&#x27;ve got a large vineyard to contend with. &gt;&gt; You gotta get going on that vineyard in January already and make sure that you can get it done. &gt;&gt; But if you&#x27;ve got a smaller venue, you can definitely like push it. And if you feel like you can get your pruning done within a week or two. &gt;&gt; By all means, waiting is good. &gt;&gt; And then you also want to know how much cold is there yet to come. &gt;&gt; That&#x27;s a, that&#x27;s a good way of evaluating through but survival, evaluating how you should be proved and deciding when to start that pruning. Like I said, we sometimes start in January already. &gt;&gt; Quite often we do, but February and March are probably the best times for pruning. &gt;&gt; You&#x27;ve got some of the harsh is cold, temperature is already out of the way and you can already do some BAD evaluation. You can slice into your butts and determine whether they&#x27;re fully alive or whether you have some damage. &gt;&gt; And you will have to adjust your pruning. &gt;&gt; If you got complete damaged, you&#x27;re gonna have to do some kind of drastic we&#x27;re pruning or very little pruning, I don&#x27;t know, but hopefully you have the better case where things are nice and alive and to prune is normal. And the good thing about pruning in February and March Is it still means that you have time enough for your cuts to dry out somewhat so that they don&#x27;t bleed so bad. Pruning, basically when you&#x27;re doing it earlier in the season like that in February and March. &gt;&gt; And those pruning cuts can self seal. &gt;&gt; You&#x27;re you&#x27;re setting yourself up a lot better for as a barrier to fungal diseases coming in. &gt;&gt; So less bleeding of that SAP means less infection from the trunk. &gt;&gt; Diseases that are, that were becoming quite aware of these days. &gt;&gt; So yeah, as much as you can if you can get it pruned. &gt;&gt; February, March, that&#x27;s a good thing. &gt;&gt; I guess that we start in January quite often when there&#x27;s a lot of snow, but I don&#x27;t know exactly how much more coal they have. &gt;&gt; So I have to sort of guess how this season is going to come and leave enough buds to survive. &gt;&gt; But realize that a lot of what grew last year gets pruned off, right? &gt;&gt; So this is a huge, huge difference. &gt;&gt; What was growing there comes down to basically like 10, 15% is left compared to what was there. &gt;&gt; So 90 or 85% comes off of that vine every year on a mature, regular growing vine. &gt;&gt; That is. &gt;&gt; And then for us, unfortunately, we&#x27;d usually finishing pruning in April. &gt;&gt; And by April we&#x27;re starting to see a lot of sap flow. &gt;&gt; So we know that there&#x27;s some, there&#x27;s plenty of chance for fungal infection would be happening when we&#x27;re pruning in April So that&#x27;s that sample generally starts moving in March when we get some of those warm days later March especially, but it really starts gushing in April when you&#x27;re cutting. &gt;&gt; And that&#x27;s just inviting a lot of fungal infection. &gt;&gt; So a lot of cold, cold and diseases had been causing issues in our minds as we well know. &gt;&gt; And pruning a little bit earlier is just one of those techniques that we can use in Minnesota or the Midwest to avoid some of that fungus pressure. &gt;&gt; Other parts of the country would recommend pruning later because they have so much rain during their pruning season, they get reign during January and February. So that&#x27;s when they are getting fungal infections. So It&#x27;s just gotta be aware of where you are at and why you&#x27;re doing what you&#x27;re doing. Just want to show a couple of symptoms of some cold injury and diseases. So some years we get these just blowing, low humidity, windy days in February and such and January. &gt;&gt; And you see that tron sexually desiccating and splitting like this. So that&#x27;s, that&#x27;s not a good thing. &gt;&gt; You know, you&#x27;re exposing yourself to the elements that way. Other years you get cold injury where it shows up like a little bit of a wedge of death. &gt;&gt; And that second middle photo, you can see that wedge, that real sharp wedge. And then the vine tried to heal over with callous material. &gt;&gt; That&#x27;s pretty much from cold injury right there. But there&#x27;s some other like little brown spots that are related to fungal issues as well. &gt;&gt; And then the far right photo here is that&#x27;s pretty much fungal activity going on. &gt;&gt; So some of your trumped diseases pop it in right there exclusively. And that&#x27;s not from cold injury. &gt;&gt; So let&#x27;s get back to the chart and let&#x27;s just look at, take a look at what is going on in the vine throughout the season. &gt;&gt; We talked all about these already. &gt;&gt; So what I want to do is break down month by month what is going on. &gt;&gt; So let&#x27;s just take March and April sort of together because they seem to be running. &gt;&gt; Similar things are going on in those months. &gt;&gt; And likewise with the other activities. You can see that in March or April, there&#x27;s, there&#x27;s at first chance to do herbicide or a pre-emergent herbicides before your bud swell. And then towards the later in April, you know, there&#x27;s pruning is that you&#x27;re trying to clear and you might be doing a mowing, you maybe having to do a fungicide. If you&#x27;re doing a Darwin spray, sometimes even an insecticide, depending if the flea beetles that you&#x27;re not. &gt;&gt; So let&#x27;s just kind of see, this is all about so March and early April, we hope that we&#x27;re finished pruning before the budget swelling. &gt;&gt; And if you can get your wires tightened and check the trellis for repair needs before the season gets going. &gt;&gt; That&#x27;s a good thing. &gt;&gt; And you definitely want to have your vines tied up. &gt;&gt; So the last photo in the corner, we use some green ties there. You can use any kind of tying material that you want. But whatever you do and just make sure you&#x27;re vines or state and secure to those stakes. &gt;&gt; And then you get your cord on its established nicely or the canes on, on that fruit wire as best as you can. It&#x27;s just going to save you a lot of headache. &gt;&gt; I usually put ties about every foot, ten inches along the buy-in and starting from the ground up. &gt;&gt; So it just gives you an idea how much we&#x27;re actually tying these vines. &gt;&gt; One thing you can do also by the end of the, before the buds started swelling too much is clear. &gt;&gt; Those pruning aisles, you probably can&#x27;t do it when the snow is laying there, but I usually get a grapple on the skid loader, grapple fork attachment, and then just clear all those pruning zone when the ground is dry enough to drive on without leaving ruts. And some years that works easier than others. &gt;&gt; This year was fabulous for that. &gt;&gt; Other years you&#x27;ll get stuck in some of the wet spots. If you&#x27;re trying to go at this too early, other people opt out of, instead of clearing on the brush out what they try to flail moment. It is an option too for people, but it just want to realize if you&#x27;ve got some diseases, would, you might want to get that out of there? And then before you, and once you get that out of there, it&#x27;s really nice to get some of those herbicides down before the buds of swollen. &gt;&gt; So in this, in this bottom left corner photo, you can see that the buttons are swelling down at the base of that young B9. &gt;&gt; And that is not a time to be doing any kind of herbicide anymore. &gt;&gt; For sure. &gt;&gt; You would&#x27;ve had to have that herbicide done a few weeks earlier already, which in this photo it was. &gt;&gt; You can see the weeds that were there dying out and get the grass. &gt;&gt; Aisles are still growing nicely. &gt;&gt; And this early part of the season, Some people are thinking about doing their dormant sprays for in fact notice for example, fungicide spray with sulfur of sorts. So as I saying, there&#x27;s a very narrow window, usually in late March or early April to effectively spray and keep you brought in your vineyard role clean, like this. &gt;&gt; Like you see, you can do this with a combination of contact or systemic herbicides, as well as pre-emergent herbicides that keep the weeds from coming back once you have got such a nice, clean ion like this. And so by late April, you can see that those soccer shoots are at the base of the vine. And that&#x27;s not a time to be spraying Fisher. And some cases you might need some of those suckers to. &gt;&gt; So you gotta be aware if you&#x27;re buying a struggling or has too much trunk issue from cold injury or fungal, fungal truncate injury. &gt;&gt; That way you might be needed to grow up some new suckers. So you gotta be aware that you can sometimes save suckers and that will really determine what pre-emergence herbicides that you might be using. Alright, well, it&#x27;s just kinda like focus in on a little bit of like later April when we&#x27;re getting into that bud swell, bud break kinda time, we might be thinking about doing that. &gt;&gt; Some are going there and maybe moving into some of those fungicide, insecticide applications if necessary. Let&#x27;s see what it looks like. &gt;&gt; Yeah. So late April is typically when we&#x27;re seeing the bots. &gt;&gt; Well, and I absolutely want to have the pruning and tying wrapped up by this season. You know, my goal is always have things situated by mid, mid April tax time, you got divines pruned and you get your airlines tied, and then you&#x27;re ready to grow. So that by the time you see sometimes by but breaker bud burst It&#x27;s happening. You might see these flea beetles and I&#x27;ve, I haven&#x27;t seen them every year, but I certainly do see them some years more than others. &gt;&gt; These lists will drill holes in your bads like this. &gt;&gt; And if they do too much of a number on that, but they&#x27;re going to destroy the fruit and that entire shoot. So if you see a couple of these, these guys on your vines, It probably going to have to start taking action before they chew up more than 20% here. &gt;&gt; But there&#x27;s certain threshold there. So you can kinda realize how much you can tolerate or not. &gt;&gt; You don&#x27;t have to spray if it&#x27;s just one or two Beatles throughout the whole vineyard. But if you seeing length two or three or four Beatles per vine, you might want to think about taking some action. Other things going on in late April, you know, the grass is coming in, hopefully you&#x27;re pruning are cleared like we talked about, or at least mode. &gt;&gt; And then you want to be able to start mowing down the grass. &gt;&gt; It&#x27;s getting usually to be very warm and plenty of moisture available in that time a year. &gt;&gt; So you gotta get ready for that shoot growth. &gt;&gt; And you also gotta beware of that. Sometimes there are some spring freezes I&#x27;m going to roll through. Some years. They just take care of the suckers for you like that. And other years it might take care of your top of your vine, unfortunately. &gt;&gt; So and let&#x27;s, let&#x27;s move into the start of May in Minnesota. &gt;&gt; I have seen it in some years where the violence can go from like a one inch shoot to more than a foot in less than two weeks or so. And then that means the races on when your buttons go from that photo on the left, two shoots like that on the right, you know, you got a lot of work going on, especially if that happens within two weeks. &gt;&gt; There&#x27;s somebody jobs that are needing attention simultaneously. &gt;&gt; It&#x27;s very hard to keep up on everything, so you really gotta be ready for that. &gt;&gt; So my advice is always to be sure that you&#x27;re vines are looking like this. &gt;&gt; So we&#x27;re not quite at that stage this year, but if this was May of a given year, that&#x27;s how you want your minds looking tied up, ready to go. &gt;&gt; So then you can be ready to do whatever needs to be done coming up, which will be some shoot thinning and the suffering and all those other good jobs. &gt;&gt; If you are tying in May, which happens for us almost every year anyway at the horticultural research center, you&#x27;ve just gotta be aware. &gt;&gt; Then you&#x27;ve gotta be so Delegate with those bads because you&#x27;re going to knock them off when you&#x27;re trying to move here. &gt;&gt; Your shoots, canes, and position. &gt;&gt; So just be very careful if you are at this stage right now and you got bugs out there and you haven&#x27;t tied yet. You gotta be so delicate so you don&#x27;t want to lose more fruit by knocking off those bads. &gt;&gt; Because then you could just as well have the flea beetles to those buttons are the frost take you buds away. &gt;&gt; And there&#x27;s no reason that we should be breaking our points at that time unless you are intentionally shoot thinning, which we&#x27;ll get into. &gt;&gt; So lets look at me with all those jobs that are going onward. &gt;&gt; Hopefully we&#x27;re finished up. &gt;&gt; Tying and disappearing is something that&#x27;s starting shoot thinning and starting. &gt;&gt; We probably are going to be starting to talk. &gt;&gt; Or BSP lines are vertical shoot positioning vines. And may is also a great time to be planting new vines. As you can see, sometimes you can be planting in April. &gt;&gt; And in fact, this year we did get the plant. &gt;&gt; And April, it&#x27;s probably the first time and about a decade or something that I&#x27;ve been able to plant. &gt;&gt; And April, because the ground is just perfect and dried out enough last few years has been. So when we&#x27;ve had to wait until May or June EVE indicator vines in the ground. Your other jobs of course, you know, the mowing and the fungicides May is really a critical time to start your fungicide applications in the vineyard. So there&#x27;s some really key early season sprays that you want to be doing in May to keep giving you clean and then follow up. &gt;&gt; Throw in bloom in June and July. &gt;&gt; May is also a time where you might think about doing fertilizer if you need it. And not really advocating a lot of fertilizer. Because quite often if you vines are looking weird or something, it&#x27;s not always due to the lack of nutrition in the soil. It&#x27;s probably more due to root injury from, from coal or trunk injury that&#x27;s not allowing the vessels to transport the nutrients. &gt;&gt; So you gotta be understanding what&#x27;s been happening in your vineyard as far as that goes. So let&#x27;s look at ME then the sucker. &gt;&gt; And you&#x27;re vines according to the vine health. &gt;&gt; When you have great looking vines and there&#x27;s no fungal chunk, this disorder is going on and you don&#x27;t have cold injury going on, you can disagree those vines very easily. &gt;&gt; But if you do have winter injured vines or you&#x27;ve got some issues that you think you might need suckers and you got it? &gt;&gt; You gotta be planning on leaving some of those suckers and not wiping everything clean. You also, we&#x27;re doing a little bit of shoot thinning if you have chord on mines in May, because there&#x27;s always a lot of non-count buds that are left on the chord on. &gt;&gt; We&#x27;ll talk about that a little bit in an upcoming slide. &gt;&gt; But shoot thinning is very key in me. &gt;&gt; It&#x27;s easiest to be done and may rather than June and July gets to be too unwieldy, then. &gt;&gt; And then you&#x27;d begin shoot positioning if you&#x27;ve got a vertical shoot positioning trellis in May, so you can see that bottom right corner photo where the shoots are starting to reach up into the catch wires. &gt;&gt; You start doing that, touching upward as the vines continue to develop. &gt;&gt; So like I said, some years, some vines can really sucker. And that&#x27;s using an indication that there&#x27;s some trouble upward on the top of the vine. So that bind, the big photo where Jenny standing there with all that soccer is flushing out of the ground. &gt;&gt; There&#x27;s very poor connection to the top of that bind. &gt;&gt; And so the vine is finding outlets through those suckers to get rid of its sap flow energy. If you have a good vine that&#x27;s in good condition, you&#x27;ll have fewer receptors, but you always, usually gets suckers to some extent, no matter what. &gt;&gt; There&#x27;s very few varieties that once you do soccer, them, they stay, we&#x27;ll clean. It&#x27;s almost always that you&#x27;re gonna have to do some D sectoring every year. &gt;&gt; And kind of along the lines of disappearing, but different. This is shoot thinning on cordons. &gt;&gt; You know, if you can get your shoots thinned to the appropriate amount, you can have nice open canopies later in the summer. In an ideal world, I guess we&#x27;re putting like about six shoots per foot of trellis. &gt;&gt; So those red lines are marking off about a foot on that trellis. &gt;&gt; That&#x27;s an ideal world. &gt;&gt; Of course, this is usually what is happening. You know, you got a lot of stuff going on within that foot. &gt;&gt; So if there&#x27;s ten plus shoots in any given distance of your chord on, you can realize that for those can go in which shoots should go. &gt;&gt; Usually look for the ones that don&#x27;t have fruit. &gt;&gt; Also though, you gotta keep in mind that you want shoots that are going to give you good spur positions for the next season. So sometimes if a chute is coming directly from the chord on and it has a good position, but it doesn&#x27;t have much fruit. &gt;&gt; I will still keep it because I know I&#x27;m going to use that guy for next year&#x27;s spring position. &gt;&gt; Otherwise you&#x27;re gonna get that spur creep going on and you&#x27;re going to get the Asperger&#x27;s longer and longer, which gets to be like a big fruits, ONE that gets out of control and it makes more canopy work that you have to deal with. &gt;&gt; Song just being a little bit judicious about shoot thinning, it&#x27;s a good thing. &gt;&gt; And Mayo word, we&#x27;re definitely looking at mowing those grass aisles if we haven&#x27;t done it already because we want to keep that grass under control. &gt;&gt; We&#x27;re thinking about applying fungicides, planting new vines, for instance. You can see that some years you really get to get in that early. But me is usually a really good time to be planting Fisher, what we&#x27;d like to do when we&#x27;re doing a new planting will pull a string so that we can get straight. Because we don&#x27;t have the trellis in place all the time at first. And this way, that string line that you can see on the bottom small photo there is right next to a tape measure. And we can measure out exactly where our plants need to go and where the posts are going to be. And then we use a little bamboo stick to, to measure off one foot from that string. &gt;&gt; Because our center of our rho then is one foot from that string. &gt;&gt; So it&#x27;s just a technique of trying to get a really nice straight row. Just an idea for you out there. &gt;&gt; Some people like to put the posts in first the previous year. &gt;&gt; That&#x27;s, that&#x27;s also a good option to put. &gt;&gt; And then of course, I always get to do the trellis thing whenever I can get it done sometime after planting, but sometimes it pushes all the way up into December like it did last year for me. And the ground wasn&#x27;t frozen last December, so I was able to do it, which is pretty cool. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And then of course, the frost events, he gotta be just a little bit wary about that. &gt;&gt; This was May 15th, 2016. &gt;&gt; We had one of those radiant freezes. &gt;&gt; Just it was just awful when such beautiful potential going on and a lot of vineyards and Minnesota, Wisconsin, and that cold air mass just slip through and, and devastate a lot of us. &gt;&gt; So be aware of that. &gt;&gt; Tips about mowing. We do mowing so that we can let the ground dry out. In the springtime, we do the mowing, so they wouldn&#x27;t get the mice and the balls from packing up and making houses all over the place and getting comfortable. &gt;&gt; And we mole so that we can keep flowers down like dandy lion. &gt;&gt; So that when we are applying, when we have to apply an insecticide, we don&#x27;t have to have that insecticide all over the flop over those flowers and bees coming up and getting that stuff. So just be aware that kinda stuff and don&#x27;t get stuck methods. &gt;&gt; If the grass is a little bit too long and you can&#x27;t tell what&#x27;s underneath it. &gt;&gt; You might be running into a wet spots. &gt;&gt; Just be careful or have somebody help you pull out of there. &gt;&gt; As I mentioned, some of those early season fungicides are really key at the beginning of the season. &gt;&gt; So I&#x27;m typically looking at mid May. &gt;&gt; Oh, and that&#x27;s coming up fairly soon here, mid-May to later part of mayor, some of those most critical sprays, so those red arrows to me are some of the most critical, critical fungicide spray applications that I can do to keep my binds from getting a lot of downy mildew, powdery mildew, and track knows whatever you may want to be dealing with. So just realize earlier, spraying is better than waiting until you see those symptoms. &gt;&gt; Because by the time you see those symptoms, it&#x27;s way too late. &gt;&gt; But there&#x27;s one good reason to spray. I did finding these one year in 2014. &gt;&gt; These beautiful morale is growing in the vineyards. &gt;&gt; Sell their fungus and fungicide would kill them. So this is something nice not to kill and they tend to follow yours when you have a lot of root injury. &gt;&gt; So the previous season, actually 20122013, that winter led to bad while it was really it was really open winter and, and a lot of root damage had occurred over that went just so the vines are kind of trying to recover in 2013. &gt;&gt; But as you can see, there&#x27;s so much black and fumble infested roots going on because they had been frozen out. And you can see the roots trying to recover a little bit with that light brown, straggly hair, but it just wasn&#x27;t enough for somebody. &gt;&gt; Two lines from that same year, that one vine took it all in stride. &gt;&gt; You know, there was some injury to the roots, but it was able to regrow plenty of fresh, new shoot roots out. &gt;&gt; But that other vine there was just totally devastated. &gt;&gt; And if, if you&#x27;d had big vines that this had happened to those, what those vines ever giving us those nice morale flushes and the 2014. So it can kind of imagine, I mean, there&#x27;s some benefit to everything, right? &gt;&gt; You gotta look on the bright side, but it really does suck to see your vineyards injured this band. And so if you can realize that your roots are sometimes getting that injured, that&#x27;s maybe more the reason why they&#x27;re not getting the nutrients they need because they don&#x27;t, they&#x27;re not even able to take anything up from the soil. &gt;&gt; Another thing that can happen from the cold damaged, you can get trunk injury like this. &gt;&gt; And that&#x27;s a great indication that you&#x27;ve gotta grow up some new suckers like we did in this photo. Again, that nutrient uptake on those injured trunks like that will show up like there&#x27;s a there&#x27;s a nutrient issue. These look Quranic and not getting enough nitrogen. But it&#x27;s basically because there&#x27;s too much vascular damage cuz you can see those suckers on those both those plants are still green. &gt;&gt; So don&#x27;t below that injury that was on the trunk. There&#x27;s still good good connection to the roots. So yeah, there&#x27;s just, you just gotta be aware of what&#x27;s going on and when you should be doing things. Before you do just kinda willy nilly throw fertilizer in your venue to have a very good idea to do soil sampling anyway and realize that whatever you&#x27;re doing fertilizing wise, and it&#x27;s like a web of interconnected elements going on down there and ions. &gt;&gt; And you pull on a string over here and do something with calcium adjustments, you can realize that it might be affecting things positively or negatively. &gt;&gt; On the other side of this, this, this circle or this charts, just be, just be aware. &gt;&gt; Go cautiously with fertilizing is my recommendation. &gt;&gt; Alright, just kind of reiterating that, that she sprays happening before bloom. Definitely before bloom. &gt;&gt; And bloom is in June. We&#x27;re trying to get a couple of key sprays on the vineyards so that we can stay clean later in the season. &gt;&gt; That bloom will be happening in June like this. &gt;&gt; So it&#x27;s not a very showy flower by any means, but it&#x27;s a very fragrant flowers. &gt;&gt; So if you get out and your vineyard and Jew and definitely do not miss this beautiful scent of the, of the grapevine bloom. It&#x27;s just, it&#x27;s just wonderful. &gt;&gt; This one&#x27;s even, this flower is pretty cool because got little pink stigmas on, on those flowers. &gt;&gt; So it&#x27;s got a lot of times are more yellowish or whitish, but these ones are actually paying. That&#x27;s pretty cool. So let&#x27;s look at June, what&#x27;s all going on. &gt;&gt; We are in bloom season, were disappearing still. &gt;&gt; Probably, I always do a little of this occurring before. &gt;&gt; If I have to do an extra herbicide application, I will be making sure that the dis occurring is done well beforehand. &gt;&gt; You&#x27;re doing some shoot thinning, you starting the fruit, than maybe in June, it definitely getting those VSP vines tucked up in there. Not quite combing yet with the High Court on lines, but you can be doing some leaf pulling for the BSP and High Court on at that time a year and lateral shoot removal. We might even by the end of June, have to start hedging the BSP. So let&#x27;s see what the stuff looks like. Oh, yeah. And then also, you know, you&#x27;re mowing and fungicides and all that. &gt;&gt; A continuing month of June. &gt;&gt; June. &gt;&gt; You were definitely continuing the work that we were doing in May if we haven&#x27;t got it all done and whenever l all the way down until the snow flies. &gt;&gt; But leaf removal after balloon is generally something I like to do. &gt;&gt; Get those clusters early in the sun, like right around bloom, right shortly after blooms, so that they can grow and develop in the sun is the best. We&#x27;re training our young minds, soccer&#x27;s. So I&#x27;ve got a young vineyard. We&#x27;re doing a lot of training in June, choosing the shoots that we want. We&#x27;re trimming our VSP chutes as they outgrow that trellis. &gt;&gt; And we might be doing herbicide application, but be aware of drift that can happen not only from your vineyard, what from all the other farmers that might be spraying out there and you know, some of the crops, there&#x27;s a lot of drift floating around and Jun&#x27;s just be be careful. &gt;&gt; Sheets will need tucking in the catch wires multiple times through and June, if you are doing this kind of growing system, I try to get through at least weekly on the talking because if you want that nice narrow effect like you see in the bottom corner photo by the by harvest season &gt;&gt; You gotta be on top of it early, early, early, early to get it to look like that. Highway airlines, they can kinda just do is they will, you know, there are two succulent at this moment, the comb downward. So we just let him do, we can do a little bit. I shoot thinning? Yeah, shoot thinning and leaf pulling and lateral shoot removal if we want to. &gt;&gt; But yeah, it&#x27;s it&#x27;s definitely too early to be combing those shoes in June. &gt;&gt; June leaf and lateral show removal, as I mentioned, allows for good open canopies later in some summer. So you want to try to get on that as best you can as early as it can. &gt;&gt; And bloom, just realize occurs over the course of a few weeks, depending on your variety and depending on the heat of a particular season. There&#x27;s so many other training decisions that need to go on in early June for your young vineyards. And really, the skilled labor is just invaluable to, to get this job done correctly. Because you gotta be able to have the eyesight to realize sometimes what grew last year is not worth keeping and you have better suckers coming up this season, especially on like a second year. The vineyard, or if the things grew well enough and you can keep that growth, can, you can roll with what was there? &gt;&gt; You know, there&#x27;s, there&#x27;s all kinds of nuance to this training. &gt;&gt; It is kinda trickier and elusive to a beginning growers. &gt;&gt; So you want to, you want to get a good idea about how to train those vines and their early seasons. &gt;&gt; Because that&#x27;s only going to set your vines up for success down the road. &gt;&gt; If you&#x27;re choosing the right material early on to establish your Pines, VSP vines, they definitely need trimming. &gt;&gt; As those shoots grow out of the trellis, we usually Trim Our shoots at least 14 inches above that top catch wire pair so that we want to get them before they start nodding off and hanging down again. &gt;&gt; But we want we want to get them high enough up there so that we&#x27;re getting are 15 leaves established or 15, no one&#x27;s on no issue. &gt;&gt; Now, as I mentioned, being aware of that drift, there is two for D That can be float around in the air. &gt;&gt; So, and something that is definitely drifting off of not only like farmers fields, but even like neighbors, lawns and stops. &gt;&gt; I do the Wieden feed stuff that you&#x27;ll get this kind of look on your vines sometime. &gt;&gt; So it can definitely hurt your flower clusters if this is happening around June. And that&#x27;s why you can have some poor fruits. &gt;&gt; And sometimes those June sprays are continuing to keep the fungus at bay. &gt;&gt; A situation where we didn&#x27;t do any spray on this vine and may, and we got this, this look up, anthrax knows pitting on, on the vine in June. There&#x27;s nothing we can do to salvage that shoot anymore. &gt;&gt; It&#x27;s basically done. &gt;&gt; We can even use it next year. So you just want to get on that sprays and continue those sprays. But be aware you don&#x27;t want to be spraying when the flowers are blooming, you try to gauge that window. &gt;&gt; So you spray before and after bloom and not doing so much, cuz you can kinda gum up that there was a stigma is on the pistols and prevent the pollen from actually setting setting on top and making a pollen tube cell &gt;&gt; Thoughts or infection. Some of you know about this, especially on some of her ideas like the front-back family, you can get really bad and July, if you haven&#x27;t treated earlier. And I found one of the most effective ways to treat vlog Gira was very early in the season with a, with a systemic chemical like a pie refund by re-throw OID where I was hitting flea beetles. &gt;&gt; I also knocked out the philosopher at then. &gt;&gt; So just be aware that the philosopher is the early goals are there at the first five and shoot stage usually. &gt;&gt; So you can, you can take care of it are already back then and what would beat me. &gt;&gt; But if you wait until July, you&#x27;re going to have these crinkled up leaves like this. And speaking of July, Luke, who is making that appearance sometimes even before July, we&#x27;re getting that Japanese beetles come in. &gt;&gt; July has become one, that month of the great Japanese beetle battle for us. &gt;&gt; And this case I think threshold was met. &gt;&gt; So started spraying those buggers down. &gt;&gt; Usually, if I start seeing like 20 to 30% of the canopy getting chewed up, I&#x27;m going to have to take action and down once, once you&#x27;ve got those leaves broken open, they just keep attracting more and more. &gt;&gt; So I even try to preemptively get rid of them somewhat earlier no. &gt;&gt; And prevent more those leaves from from getting broken open and, and letting out their chemical signals and smells. &gt;&gt; I mean, the, the Beatles themselves have like a pheromone that attracts each other. &gt;&gt; But it&#x27;s also like the broken vegetative tissue that also attracts more of them to come flocking together like this July, Look at all those different jobs. &gt;&gt; We&#x27;re right in the thick of it still. So it&#x27;s not a great time for vacation yet. &gt;&gt; If there ever is, during the growing season, we got fruit thinning going on. &gt;&gt; We get tucking, kind of finishing up the tucking of the BSP shoots. &gt;&gt; We&#x27;re really starting to get into the combing, the shoot positioning of the high wire court on vines. Still doing a lot of leaf pulling and lateral shoot removal, and then hedging of both VSP and and high-wire chord on our skirting, as we like to call it, has basically shoot tipping or topping and off like John Young vineyards, you might be staking and training and taping and all that stuff to throw on July the rest of this is we&#x27;ve seen this plenty of times, but you&#x27;re still thinking, and maybe if you haven&#x27;t done a herbicide and you can kind of squeeze one of those in the middle of the season. &gt;&gt; I&#x27;m not saying you have to do herbicide four or five times a year. &gt;&gt; Maybe you can get by with a key to herbicides in a season if you&#x27;re really on top of your game, or maybe three at the most. &gt;&gt; What and there&#x27;s other methods too, but just relay. &gt;&gt; Awesome. &gt;&gt; July usually I get her on the fourth of July. &gt;&gt; I&#x27;m doing another herbicide spray. &gt;&gt; Boeing&#x27;s according to the the drought and of course, like irrigation and stuff, you might be picking up Irrigation a little bit more when it&#x27;s dry and a July. &gt;&gt; So we&#x27;re continuing those tasks from June. We&#x27;re adjusting fruit levels where needed. &gt;&gt; So especially on young minds, we want to drop some fruit if it&#x27;s a little bit too, too much. &gt;&gt; And that first year to a fruiting haywire trained vines, they need a little bit more attention now, like I said, so on. And then we&#x27;re thinking the one-year gating and spray needs in July. &gt;&gt; Sometimes &gt;&gt; Just getting back to that, dropping the fruit like a young mind is very sensitive to that high crop load. So if you&#x27;re going to, if you&#x27;re going to overburden a young mind that really can set it back for that coming winter. And it can really hurt it&#x27;s buying hardiness if it&#x27;s being forced to fruit too much in that first year, too, that it&#x27;s allowed to fruit by the end of July. This is what your vertical shoot positioning vines can look like. Get them nice and trimmed and hedged. &gt;&gt; You gotta still 15 nodes along those shoots to ripen the fruit to ripen that would feed the roots and all that business at that fruit zone and leaves and laterals and then fruit zone, you want that really nice and open at that point. &gt;&gt; So this is kind of looking down VSP row in July. &gt;&gt; If you got everything going good, you got the shoots trimmed about 14 inches above the top wire is there still, and you get the leaves pulled around the fruit zone. &gt;&gt; Let net son come writing then and help make that fruit really, really nice for the fall. &gt;&gt; And remember those high wire train vines back in early June, this is kinda what they were looking like. And June they start coming down in, in throat late June and July. &gt;&gt; So they&#x27;re going to need a little bit of assistance, and we call that combing positioning. &gt;&gt; So they need the most attention through July and into August and these high wire. So whereas VSP, You had a lot of work in June and July. &gt;&gt; Now I chord and you got a lot more work in June, July, and August. &gt;&gt; So we had to wait, of course, because those shoots for two succulent to do it too early binds. &gt;&gt; So but this is what you&#x27;re hoping for. &gt;&gt; After that combing is done, you got nice spaced shoots, Nice Lee, open fruit. &gt;&gt; So this photo is of the same vine. &gt;&gt; Both of these photos, just one is in July and then one is more nearing harvest. You can see how, how nice that is to have that stuff open like that often. &gt;&gt; This is what we&#x27;re seeing now in more densely kinda grown buy-in. &gt;&gt; But it would definitely be better to have this, you know, this is, this kind of what we&#x27;re going for. &gt;&gt; You know, sunlight is really the quality component to all of this. You know, with the, the better our fruit CAN BE, flavor it up by the sun, sunlight, and everything, the better off our wines are going to be. And I mean, that&#x27;s what really what&#x27;s driving our quality is getting good quality fruit grown in the vineyard like this, not growing it in a dense shade canopy, that&#x27;s not going to do anybody any good. &gt;&gt; I talked about irrigation. So some seasons when you do plant young vineyards, you, you got a dry season coming up. &gt;&gt; And maybe we have one of those coming up now in 2020. Who knows? &gt;&gt; But you definitely gotta do some irrigation. &gt;&gt; So here I am with the water wagon and a wand. &gt;&gt; Watering alone, he can do drip line irrigation if you wish. &gt;&gt; Can run. &gt;&gt; There&#x27;s lots of different methods, but generally we don&#x27;t need irrigation beyond like year two. &gt;&gt; There&#x27;s some years where it was dry it two years in a row. Had to water year two. &gt;&gt; After year three, I usually let the vines go on their own in Minnesota, are doing what we would call and dry farming from there on out, because we don&#x27;t really get that dry and Minnesota like they do in California. &gt;&gt; But here&#x27;s what has been going on in the last few years. &gt;&gt; Of course, very, very when vineyard standing in water had diseases like you wouldn&#x27;t believe. &gt;&gt; There&#x27;s black rod corner in the left corner. &gt;&gt; I was even seen a lot of portraitist in these past few years, which we normally don&#x27;t get so bad. &gt;&gt; But when it was really high humidity and wet like this. &gt;&gt; But Petraeus was actually starting to set in. &gt;&gt; Not very typical for our Minnesota variety. &gt;&gt; I do like training the vines in this time, a year of July. &gt;&gt; Instead of topping the wines and, and making the laterals grown, I continue that shoot tip, the niches bended over onto the fruiting wire that I want and keep it training so that it&#x27;s ready to go and fruiting for the following season and biogas will, hopefully it does dry. &gt;&gt; All right, hey, here&#x27;s some binds that are still growing and continue to be trained on the high wire from being planted early in the season. And you can see that ground and the background is waiting for a grass seed. &gt;&gt; So if it&#x27;s dry enough conditions for that, we can do some grass sewing fairly soon before September comes around. &gt;&gt; So just kind of focusing in on August. &gt;&gt; Here we&#x27;re hitting vibration in the, in the fruit, the color change, right? The very softening happening with variation. Still doing all those jobs, combing, leaf pulling, keeping the fruit expose, hedging, skirting, all that good stuff, training young ones, kinda moving. &gt;&gt; Hopefully we&#x27;ve probably been doing a few Japanese beetle sprays. Keeping things mode. When variation does hit, we gotta start thinking about pest control and meeting the vines. &gt;&gt; And you gotta have your vineyard set and ready for that. &gt;&gt; So what that can look like. So here we go. &gt;&gt; Hopefully you got your canopy situated the way you want it. &gt;&gt; By the time variation starts looking like this, but this is when the fruits really starts looking attractive to the animals. So pest control is very important as far as netting goes. And August can be a time where you can catch your breath, hopefully before harvest. But did you gotta make sure that your, your harvest equipment is all in good working order before you do take that little vacation up north or whatever you do the the summer work on the BSP and the High Court on should all be caught up is what I was saying. &gt;&gt; So if you get everything situated, you&#x27;re ready for those nets to go on, you know, you won&#x27;t be able to do any more fruit exposure. So It&#x27;s kind of a nice time a year when you can just kind of back it up and then walk away for a little bit of time. &gt;&gt; Hopefully maybe get to trellis done that you needed to. As you can see here we on this BSP type of a trellis, we always hang our knitting. &gt;&gt; On that on those clips, on those those wire clips there called Catch wire clips, I guess. &gt;&gt; And it&#x27;s kind of a nice little spot where you can hang your nets and get, get everything singed up so the birds don&#x27;t have any room to get in there. We&#x27;re definitely gonna start beginning to monitor our fruit as it&#x27;s ripening throughout August. So you want to be able to start tracking how, how that sugars are rising and how they acids are starting to drop and your fruits. &gt;&gt; So you can make some predictive models about when you might be thinking of, of picking and harvesting. &gt;&gt; And all this time you&#x27;d be in contact with your the winery or if you are the winery that&#x27;s picking the fruit, you can, you can kinda target in conversation with the winemaker about when you expect this stuff to start coming in. And it&#x27;s definitely a team effort at that point to decide when to pull that trigger is also other cool things to watch out for. &gt;&gt; Sometimes you get these little mutations in the front neck family, sometimes they stay and sometimes they disappear after a season. &gt;&gt; But it&#x27;s pretty cool to see that kind of stuff. &gt;&gt; I like I said, I&#x27;d like to get the grass someone in right before September if I can, so that the rains and the coolness of September gets a really good germination of that grass gone. And so here we&#x27;re gonna kinda take September and October together. &gt;&gt; As far as zone season, it&#x27;s basically Harvest. &gt;&gt; Harvest is the primary goal of September and October, of course. &gt;&gt; And we&#x27;ll keep an eye on the fruit evaluation as we&#x27;re going to see what else the past controlled with immense, Of course, if you haven&#x27;t done you gotta keep an eye on you might be thinking about protecting your fruit to from spotted wing Drosophila, the fruit flies that are coming in then in ravaging the fruit. Sometimes they usually don&#x27;t get into the grapes to bad, but there are some soft skin varieties that they will drill into. So these are, this is hopefully what your vineyard is starting to look like. And those minds just beautiful, good-looking fruit ready to get picked. &gt;&gt; And what is that? &gt;&gt; Our deal rightness though that question kinda comes up and it&#x27;s different for different varieties of course. &gt;&gt; But if you kind of target between 2025 bricks, usually that leads to a decent decently good alcohol level later on and after fermentation. &gt;&gt; And as far as the young titratable acidity goes, if you can get it between 10710 grams per liter, that&#x27;s usually kind of a nice zone because anything, if you&#x27;re getting far beyond ten, if you get like 15 grams per liter is something that gets to be a pretty acidic wine and harder to handle in the winery and harder to make it palatable. &gt;&gt; Why not that kind of stuff? Again, the pH to relate it to the acidity and the components of the acids. &gt;&gt; The pH being between 3.13.3 is usually kind of a nice targeting thing. Of course, you can take a look at seed color, skin and pull texture. How well are you pedestals, your stems holding up, or your berries showing off like La Crescent does, you gotta get it pulled before another windstorm comes. &gt;&gt; You know, those are all considerations to go along with ideal rightness. But I&#x27;d, like I said that good king acid chemistry. &gt;&gt; If we can get varieties that are under ten grams per liter, that&#x27;s, that&#x27;s really nice. &gt;&gt; I mean, it&#x27;s, it&#x27;s good for the winemaker&#x27;s is good for the wine. At the end of the day Our task is able to do that. Sometimes. &gt;&gt; This is bar cat, my cat does come under ten grams per liter sometimes, but usually it&#x27;s hovering more bone, 11 or 12 grams per liter, at least in, in Minnesota. Here&#x27;s another thing to help with that acid chemistry is shaded fruit versus sun ripen fruit. The more you get that fruit in the sun, the better off you hear a juice chemistry is going to be. So you can have better bricks, lower acids, nice ph, with more sun ripen fruit. Okay, the bottom left photo is La Crescent in the shade. &gt;&gt; In the bottom right is La Crescent in the sun. &gt;&gt; I know which one I want to drink. &gt;&gt; As far as nets goes, netting, you gotta live those nets and you don&#x27;t want to do it before harvest too, too far in advance. &gt;&gt; You don&#x27;t want to do it a day or a week before harvest. You want to do it basically the hours before harvest because the birds can come in so easily or the raccoons can come in so easily overnight and just start taking away all that fruit that you&#x27;d been working so hard to save. &gt;&gt; So I don&#x27;t unrolled and that&#x27;s Until immediately before harvest. &gt;&gt; And you can roll it nets later, of course, unless you have a mechanical harvester that&#x27;s coming through and you gotta get that net out of the way. So just gotta be considering though, is kinda offer yourself here. You&#x27;ve got some barriers that just couldn&#x27;t hang. They couldn&#x27;t tolerate the fall. &gt;&gt; So sometimes this happens, you get the splitting going on and that&#x27;s just inviting bacteria and fruit flies and all that nastiness. So if this is happening, well, you gotta do something quick or you&#x27;re going to have to drop that fruit. &gt;&gt; And some righties handle this better than your fortunately, knock on wood. &gt;&gt; So far, i task has been looking really good at harvest, not splitting, not getting too nasty like that. &gt;&gt; So, and it also has that nice little pink indicator barriers you can see right there. &gt;&gt; Course, harvest does land on different days every year. &gt;&gt; So depending on the weather and intended wine style. And you know, this is this is September 29th of 2012, very hot, dry year. This was my market. &gt;&gt; It my parents farm or sorry, a front-to-back and my parents farm, Brown that grass was, but just beautiful fruit. And we got so nice and ripe and there was kind of a youngish lines at that point anyway. &gt;&gt; But look at that next year, 2013, that right photo. &gt;&gt; We were picking it out on October 12th and then even October 26th, that Same the same vines. &gt;&gt; So it just goes to show like harvest can be all over the place from one year to the net. &gt;&gt; And just to let you know that front and back and front, I agree. &gt;&gt; Can really hang through some of those freezes. Some years we&#x27;ve been making some really interesting wines from letting them hang through a couple of frost. And if you&#x27;re gonna do this to any variety, I think the front and back and and frankly, are probably the best candidates for letting them hang through a freeze because They can tolerated. They I mean, most binds prefer to have their fruit taken off before the freeze comes, right? So they get wet, ready for winter a little bit better. &gt;&gt; But if there&#x27;s anything that&#x27;s going to tolerate it, it&#x27;s this fraud to next family. So you can abuse them a little bit that way if you want, doesn&#x27;t make for interesting wines. I gotta say. &gt;&gt; The other thing that we&#x27;re looking at, at around harvest or after harvest is that paradigm developing along the shoots that would ripening, that starts to lignified, turn brown. And wherever it stops, that&#x27;s, that&#x27;s as far as you&#x27;re going to have that shoot ripen too. &gt;&gt; So if it stops early, you&#x27;re going to have, you&#x27;re not going to be pruning with Keynes the next year, put it that way, will be spurred pruning Muslim. &gt;&gt; Here we go. &gt;&gt; And now you&#x27;re seeing some nice, in essence, the leaves are starting to turn yellow and starting to fall off pretty soon. And that&#x27;s, that&#x27;s really nice time a year. So if you can leave your vines hang, like I was saying, without, without fruit and then get into this stage of yellow, you know, that&#x27;s a, that&#x27;s a better thing Of course. &gt;&gt; But again, you know what the prompt any family you can put in. This is the latest, we&#x27;ve ever pushed it for varieties for harvesting. &gt;&gt; This was November seventh of 2015. &gt;&gt; This was some reasoning minds that we had on the property. &gt;&gt; But yeah, there was eye and seen those vines get so nice and ripe and golden in since all my years there. &gt;&gt; So it&#x27;s been it was pretty cool. All right. &gt;&gt; Well, what are we doing now and the end of the season, November, December, it seems like everything is done right. &gt;&gt; I just walk away from the vignette. Well, using though we still heavily trellis things to fix and we do some vineyard inventories. &gt;&gt; We got nets to roll, possibly, I&#x27;m definitely doing. &gt;&gt; They got last grass mowing if I can. &gt;&gt; And as we move into December, would definitely think about baiting those goals. &gt;&gt; And mice, you want to keep those things from girdling. &gt;&gt; You&#x27;re vines over the winter course is supply orders and chemicals. &gt;&gt; You can think about doing that stuff in the winter. Equipment trainings and other training is going on in the winter, conferences and so forth. &gt;&gt; But yeah, this is just not a time to like, shut your mind off and forget about it all for 23 months. &gt;&gt; And there&#x27;s still plenty in stopping in November and December. &gt;&gt; So this is like one of my last things usually before the snow flies is get that grass modes super short so I can keep the, the voles from coming in like this in the home. And they really, They came in this past year really, really bad despite the low mowing and the and all the bait that I had put out. &gt;&gt; So I don&#x27;t know. &gt;&gt; Others out there saw that same problem this past season. &gt;&gt; But we were kind of for warn that the mice in the holes will be a little bit higher population this, this past winter. It&#x27;s also a last chance for some herbicides, some fall or resign. It&#x27;s a really good time when the weeds are kind of sucking in their nutrients down to their roots to get that last little shot of glyphosate down. &gt;&gt; If you&#x27;re choosing to use something like that, it just makes a vineyard that much cleaner for the spring time. I haven&#x27;t played around with them pre- emergence in the fall, but it&#x27;s a possibility then if you put the pre-emergent down in the fall and it doesn&#x27;t rain away, it should still be there enough in the spring to keep seeds from germinating. Otherwise, might typical way of approach is I do the, do the herbicides, the pre-emergent in the springtime. And I try to get the &gt;&gt; Clean in the fall like this. It possible. It&#x27;s also good time. &gt;&gt; And like I said, they do the buying inventory or make room for better varieties, varieties that just aren&#x27;t pulling their weight. And the vineyard, you can yank them ONE, get as much routes out as possible and start making way for better varieties. &gt;&gt; So this is what we use it, a little dingo kinda stand behind dingo where you can pull those binds right up with the chain. &gt;&gt; Get as much rude on there as possible. &gt;&gt; Get the vineyard ready for something better by the end of the season, maybe you can get those other projects done that are hanging all season, right? &gt;&gt; Some Trello seeing maybe a storm came through and blew your venue down like it did here in 2007 and it was a mess. &gt;&gt; Took us a long time to get those posts all back fixed up. &gt;&gt; We temporarily put them up with pipe for half the season. &gt;&gt; And then later after harvest that was able to swap out all those what posts again. &gt;&gt; But it was a major, major pain trellis thing too. And you can do some Trello sing. &gt;&gt; I never recommend that put that ends that anchor that stable, stable like that on the post. &gt;&gt; It just gonna this is the wire going down to the anchor. Basically, I usually have it like that, drawing two separate things. &gt;&gt; You gotta anchor wiring system going on and then you got your you&#x27;re caught on wires as separate systems or I guess, yeah. Then if you are into December, you know, maybe this is a time when the minds and the grower just finally ready to rest, right? &gt;&gt; So it&#x27;s been a long season, a lot of work. &gt;&gt; It&#x27;s just really a great time to reflect and think about how we can improve for the next season coming up. So yeah, with that, you know, just really enjoy every season and you&#x27;ve been units, it&#x27;s so fun to go from winter to spring, like we&#x27;re in right now, and then head into summer and fall with the beautiful harvest. &gt;&gt; And then just keep doing it all over again. &gt;&gt; You know, it&#x27;s just enjoy every season. &gt;&gt; You can. I want to give a couple of acknowledgments out here. &gt;&gt; Dr. Matt Clark, who was a project leader, is just great to work with and I want to thank him and Annie clade for inviting me to do this talk for you guys. &gt;&gt; And I do want to give a little shout out to communism won&#x27;t. Who&#x27;s right there in the vineyards with Jenny and I day in, day out through all kinds of weather and always with a smile on his face. Just love and loving everything and what the grapes. &gt;&gt; So it&#x27;s, it&#x27;s just fun to work with all of these guys. &gt;&gt; So I really appreciate this great team and there&#x27;s a lot more of us. &gt;&gt; It&#x27;s not just us may have any con, myself. &gt;&gt; There&#x27;s lot of grad students that they didn&#x27;t even mentioned interns coming through. &gt;&gt; But yeah, it&#x27;s just fun. &gt;&gt; I mean, how can she love growing grapes, especially in Minnesota, right? Or Wisconsin or wherever you may be. &gt;&gt; So with that, I want to thank you all for tuning in. And I realize I can&#x27;t answer your questions directly right now, but one question that does come up a lot, like, how should I prove my vine and Jenny&#x27;s model? As always, when in doubt, just cut it out. &gt;&gt; Now, I mean, you can&#x27;t get that drastic, but there&#x27;s something to be said about that. &gt;&gt; Don&#x27;t be afraid to just dig into your vines and start to get to know them and do some things that are different cell. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; You guys, thank you very much. I&#x27;ll see you sometime in the future by now.</p></div><footer class="theme-doc-footer docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="theme-doc-footer-edit-meta-row row"><div class="col"><a href="https://github.com/cold-climate-grapevine/edit/documentation/docs/01-life-of-grapevine/vine-through-growing-season/README.md" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="theme-edit-this-page"><svg fill="currentColor" height="20" width="20" viewBox="0 0 40 40" class="iconEdit_Z9Sw" aria-hidden="true"><g><path d="m34.5 11.7l-3 3.1-6.3-6.3 3.1-3q0.5-0.5 1.2-0.5t1.1 0.5l3.9 3.9q0.5 0.4 0.5 1.1t-0.5 1.2z m-29.5 17.1l18.4-18.5 6.3 6.3-18.4 18.4h-6.3v-6.2z"></path></g></svg>Edit this page</a></div><div class="col lastUpdated_vwxv"></div></div></footer></article><nav class="pagination-nav docusaurus-mt-lg" aria-label="Docs pages navigation"><a class="pagination-nav__link pagination-nav__link--prev" href="/docs/life-of-grapevine/ten-key-things-about-cold-climate-grapevines/"><div class="pagination-nav__sublabel">Previous</div><div class="pagination-nav__label">10 Key Things about Cold Climate Grapevines</div></a><a class="pagination-nav__link pagination-nav__link--next" href="/docs/life-of-grapevine/anatomy-of-vineyard/"><div class="pagination-nav__sublabel">Next</div><div class="pagination-nav__label">Anatomy of a Vineyard (3D activity)</div></a></nav></div></div></div></div></main></div></div><footer class="footer footer--dark"><div class="container container-fluid"><div class="row footer__links"><div class="col footer__col"><div class="footer__title">Docs</div><ul class="footer__items clean-list"><li class="footer__item"><a class="footer__link-item" href="/docs/intro">Course</a></li></ul></div><div class="col footer__col"><div class="footer__title">Community</div><ul class="footer__items clean-list"><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/docusaurus" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item">Stack Overflow<svg width="13.5" height="13.5" aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="iconExternalLink_nPIU"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21 13v10h-21v-19h12v2h-10v15h17v-8h2zm3-12h-10.988l4.035 4-6.977 7.07 2.828 2.828 6.977-7.07 4.125 4.172v-11z"></path></svg></a></li><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://discordapp.com/invite/docusaurus" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item">Discord<svg width="13.5" height="13.5" aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="iconExternalLink_nPIU"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21 13v10h-21v-19h12v2h-10v15h17v-8h2zm3-12h-10.988l4.035 4-6.977 7.07 2.828 2.828 6.977-7.07 4.125 4.172v-11z"></path></svg></a></li><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://twitter.com/docusaurus" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item">Twitter<svg width="13.5" height="13.5" aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="iconExternalLink_nPIU"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21 13v10h-21v-19h12v2h-10v15h17v-8h2zm3-12h-10.988l4.035 4-6.977 7.07 2.828 2.828 6.977-7.07 4.125 4.172v-11z"></path></svg></a></li></ul></div><div class="col footer__col"><div class="footer__title">More</div><ul class="footer__items clean-list"><li class="footer__item"><a class="footer__link-item" href="/blog">Blog</a></li><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://github.com/cold-climate-grapevine" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item">GitHub<svg width="13.5" height="13.5" aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="iconExternalLink_nPIU"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21 13v10h-21v-19h12v2h-10v15h17v-8h2zm3-12h-10.988l4.035 4-6.977 7.07 2.828 2.828 6.977-7.07 4.125 4.172v-11z"></path></svg></a></li></ul></div></div><div class="footer__bottom text--center"><div class="footer__copyright">Copyright © 2022 My Project, Inc.
